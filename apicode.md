# api Instruction 
The API command is one of Bloxd's proprietary commands, enabling greater creativity in game world rules.  
Here's an example:
``` javascript

// myId  is like  playerId
api.setPosition(myId,[2.45,12.00,-472.86]);   // this functon can set player position
// [2.45,12.00,-472.86]  is x,y,z coordinates  

```
